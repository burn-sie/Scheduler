# Scheduler
If you have found this, this is a simple navy monthly watchbill generator i created in my spare time.

Thought i may put it here and see if anyone else finds it useful and maybe contribute make it better. Who knows, maybe it'll make someones life way less stressfull.

Steps in to use this file..
1. Answer the questions on the top of the "Panel" sheet.
2. Use the Roster table to add your personnell. (LAST, FIRST) <---Dont be lazy, add the coma or it wont work. will fix later.
3. Create your groups or sections on the right tables.
4. Switch over to the "watchbill" tab and Verify everything filled in corectly.
5. On the "watchbill" sheet, use the blank cells to to asign primary secondary.
6. Print and enjoy.


I worked on this while working a a health care setting so this is way more tailored for HMs, Feel free to modify this sheet to fit your situation.
I will try to make it more user friendly in my spare time if i can.


Notes: The box next to the roster will turn Green, Yellow, or Red, depending if the person is in a group / duty section.
       The numbers on the "Panel" sheet will update when you change something, if your feeling adventurous, Unhide the "MiscFormulas" tab and customize if you like.

Other Notes: Most formulas are hidden in hidden tabs.
             BUG: If month starts on a saturday and has 31 days, there may be a few squares missing at the end, will fix later.
             
**update as of february 2022
There is a newer revised version of this, but since i havent fixed all the new bugs yet it might take a while. That and school is taking so long i may forget to work on it.
If for some reason i forget and never post here in the future just message me and ill send you th eprobably unfinished but updated copy.
This scheduler for me is now low priority.
